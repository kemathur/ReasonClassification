       " {'comment': u\"The United States of America has been and still is a nation under God.  As a nation, we would not have enjoyed the freedom that we have had if it were not for God and those who believe in someone greater than themselves.  We pray and seek guidance from God for our leaders, neighbors, families, friends and yes, even our enemies.   We, as human beings are not perfect, yet, we can continue to strive to improve ourselves and our neighbors, through unconditional love along with a strong belief in God.  Americans should never forget that God has blessed us abundantly, but we could lose everything when we begin to believe that we did it on our own.  Should that happen, it would be a sad commentary.  We can learn from other nations and people, who left God out of their lives or erased God from their memories.  I'm not sure what NBC was thinking when they had children reciting the Pledge of Allegiance as a version minus under God. Since when do we practice such misuse of the airwaves by offering an incorrect version of our Pledge of Allegiance?  What message does that send to our children, who are the future leaders of this nation.  We must retain under God in our pledge of allegiance!\",\n",

So we link this statement with the Christian God. However, when you say this, you are mocking Jews and Muslims as if their belief of God is inferior and not a threat to be dealt with. Seperation of church and state. Hey buddy, WHICH ONE! Why do we not act like the God said isn't one respected by all other religions. Athesism is not a religion, it is the absence of religion. Therefore, in no way is this a violation of the first Amendment as it includes all religions. Even polytheistic religions believe that their gods come together to form God.\",\n",

The pledge went without conflict until the 1950's, when a Catholic interest group convinced the President to add the words. It was only once the words were added that it became a problem. Then, the recitation of the pledge became wrong for many citizens as it was now more of a prayer, both to a monotheistic God and another idol which is banned in Judaism. Thus, more and more kids are being pressured into saying things that conflict with their religion in school because by not doing so, they are thought to be unpatriotic. This may seem like a pretty stupid analogy, but personally I think it explains the concept very well. This whole debate is like sandwiches and mayonaise. Some people may be allergic to Mayo.

That was something that was added during the Cold War as a way for us to attempt to differentiate us from 'Godless heathens'. As well, the US Constitution states that our Country and Government are to be separate from any and all religions. Therefor, the current existence of the phrase Under God is something that is closer being against our nation's ideals than keeping it, it's just never been changed because a lot of people don't understand why some people want it removed. Also, it's not 'Our' flag, it's the flag of any and all American citizens, not just the ones who happen to believe in the existence of your God or any God for that matter. I believe it should be removed because it was added erroneously in the first place and furthers the misnomer other progressive countries have that we're a backwards and ignorant gathering of bigots and idiots\",\n",

For example, in the case of the pledge, how many Christians would object to One Nation, Under Krishna?nnThe Bill of Rights do not exist to protect majority privilege, the majority do not need protection.

       " {'comment': u\"Well, i think that no religious statement should be included in the Pledge of Allegiance. When people refer to any religion, they should be in the situation in which they respect and follow that specific God or Goddess (whichever, one or more) and remain in the boundaries of supporting the land in which they created. If, for example, the U.S is considered a religious country, then if they speak about God, they should consider thinking about what God does for his people, not only what he chooses for being wishy-washy. He can't prohibit something the U.S for being different or because something looks bad or inappropriate as some might say. You can't talk about a specific religion unless you truly understand it, it's not logic for anyone to think like that.\",\n",

But that does not mean that the rest of us - Hindus, homosexuals, non-religious individuals - do not exist anymore. We're still here, and we still have rights.\",\n",
