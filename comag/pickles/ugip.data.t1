VAs an devout atheist I strongly oppose this. It seems like some people don't understand that there IS  a seperation between church and state. Now I have to join the herd and recite a few words that mean nothing to me? We have something called a church that people do this in. So why is it in a public school?  Are we forgetting about those who may practice hinduism, buddhism, shintoism and other religions? What about them?  I don't care if the majority of people are Christains. SO! But since when do the majority decide what is best for everyone? Where are we in China now?  By the way, I thought as a good bunch of christains you were not suppose to mention thy lord's name in vain. CLAP CLAP Good for you.....NOT! Here you are running around using it in some nationalist verse so you can feel better about yourselves. God bless America what about the rest of the world?

And the simple yet increadibly important thing that all you Cons seem to be forgetting is that NO ONE IS FORCING YOU TO SAY OR BELIEVE ANYTHING YOU DONT WANT TO!!!! Since it was added 58 Years ago no one has been forced to believe in God, or put to death for not believing in the Almighty, nor has anyone been incarcerated for not saying those words in the pledge so quit all your meaningless bitching about how your looking for attention and want everyone to look at you, cause we both know thats what all of this is really and truely about. When we get down to the core you all just want to have everyones attention while you create problems for 89% of the country!

I learned to say the Pledge before those words were added, and I refuse to utter them today, as I believe their presence violates good sense and the Constitution.  They were added in the mid-Fifties in a rather successful attempt to mobilize American opinion against those godless communists. In other words, they were war-talk.

You that you don't have to say it if you don't want to. I am an atheist and I prefer not to say it. For a long time after they take it out (if they do, of course), people will accidentally say it from habit of it being in there so long when it didn't need to.

VI grew up with a Pledge that did not include under God in it. I was always happy to say that Pledge, which had great meaning for me.  However, somewhere along the way, under God was added and I then became embarrassed to say the Pledge because I thought that under God did not belong there. We are a country with the separation of church and state (thank God, because I believe in God) and for me, having under God in the Pledge belies that fact. If I am now ever in a situation that includes reciting the Pledge, I will of course do so but without saying those two words. The Pledge should belong to all of us and with the words under God in it, I do not think it does. Respectfully submitted.

VI grew up with a Pledge that did not include under God in it. I was always happy to say that Pledge, which had great meaning for me.  However, somewhere along the way, under God was added and I then became embarrassed to say the Pledge because I thought that under God did not belong there. We are a country with the separation of church and state (thank God, because I believe in God) and for me, having under God in the Pledge belies that fact. If I am now ever in a situation that includes reciting the Pledge, I will of course do so but without saying those two words. The Pledge should belong to all of us and with the words under God in it, I do not think it does. Respectfully submitted.

VAtheism doesn't mean the absence of religion - it means the absence of a god in one's belief system.  Certain forms of Buddhism, for example are atheistic.  Therefore, requiring a statement of belief in a god is unconstitutionally preferring a majority religious belief over a minority one.  The point of the Pledge is to state allegiance to the flag and country.  If one believes in a god, there are many, many other forums in which to express that belief without imposing it on others.

VI myself being Catholic believe that the words 'under God' should not be included in a pledge of allegiance to the flag of the United States. As is evident, the nation was based on ideals of religious freedom, and if somebody wishes to remain a patriot, pledging allegiance to their country, they should not be coerced to state something they don't believe to be true. Although a democratic government is based on majorities in the long run, in this case we very well may be violating the rights guaranteed to citizens via the Bill of Rights. The founding fathers, when constructing the constitution may have included references to their own religion, in this case Catholicism, but as we see a certain diversity being created in this past century, it is important to note that we as a nation should be more open to accept these different ideas to better suit all citizens. nnThat said, maybe it would have been easier to go along with the pledge that was first introduced which would have allowed for every citizen to feel their place in the country.

The Aithiests have thier opinion but they are completely wrong in their way of thinking and they can`t change the fact that we were founded with Biblical values in the forefront by our founding father`s and they can`t change that no matter what they say. Thier opinion is flawed and they need the prayers of the Christian community so they can have a change of heart and let the light of Jesus to shine in their hearts and not oppose our Christian values and heritage and unite with us in a common cause to save the moral values of our nation or our nation will be lost to immorality and perversion with no sense of right and wrong.

VThe so-called Under God part wasn't in the constitution until 1954 or so, when the fear of communism was around. Nothing more, and it is absurd that they put it in there to begin with, especially since there are people who don't believe, and don't care about that. Why Eisenhower did that, no idea, but I bet he didn't believe it either, it was more for purposes of propaganda, when in reality, it was a sham. As far as the constitution goes, it was put in, but people are too afraid to revert to the original. And for those who don't believe, why force it into their vocabulary, right? It would be best to let the PERSON decide if they want to say that part. It doesn't matter if you are a believer or not, since this is the land of the free, we have the right to say under god, or not to. The people should make the choice to say under god, or under the nation, or the USA. After all, our founding fathers left their country, because they wanted freedom. Shouldn't freedom be on ALL levels? If so, then we shouldn't worry about something as trivial as putting under god in the pledge. It is a choice to say under god or not.

VI am whole hardly in favor of having Under God in the Pledge of Allegiance. We are a Christian nation founded on Biblical values since our inception. We must remain a Christian nation always and never stand devided as what is happening lately. We must value our Christian heritage and teach them to our children and grandchildren. The Aithiests have thier opinion but they are completely wrong in their way of thinking and they can`t change the fact that we were founded with Biblical values in the forefront by our founding father`s and they can`t change that no matter what they say. Thier opinion is flawed and they need the prayers of the Christian community so they can have a change of heart and let the light of Jesus to shine in their hearts and not oppose our Christian values and heritage and unite with us in a common cause to save the moral values of our nation or our nation will be lost to immorality and perversion with no sense of right and wrong.

VI understand why people want that phrase in there, I do. At the same time however, how in our day and age, with such a diverse group of subcultures within our great country, can we allow something that blatantly disregards all other deities believed in by other Americans? Yes, the majority of Americans may believe in Catholicism and thus not have a problem with the phrase, but being selfless for a second, instead of self-centered, taking those two words out makes a bit of a difference to those who do not believe in that specific deity or any at all. And if we're being honest, why does it matter so much to keep it in?      Some might think, I want it in because I am a devout Christian (or whatever) and I want to represent that in my daily life. But, you know what, that's what churches and other places of worship are for.      Last time I checked, being proud to be an American meant being proud to embrace everything America is built on, namely diversity. We are supposed to be a melting pot of cultures, but with such a phrase, how can we call ourselves truly diverse? I do not think it is bad, just with all of the different religions (and lack there of) it is out of date.

Vthe term GOD is not specific to any religion. Most people have an understanding of God ...  even atheists - if ya shot their foot and got ready to shoot the other one - most could blurt out something like  OH GOD! PLEASE NO!   Sure! that was an extreme analogy but I have known too many atheists who used the Oh God!    See? ... even in a 12 step program they use the concept of GOD AS YOU UNDERSTAND HIM

If the tax exemption were a serious threat to the separation of church and state, the US government would have succumbed to religious rule long ago. (More reason for Churches and Church Related organizations to be penalized for raising funds and waging campaigns with Civil outcomes) As the Supreme Court ruled in Walz v. Tax Commission of the City of New York (1970), freedom from taxation for two centuries has not led to an established church or religion, and, on the contrary, has helped to guarantee the free exercise of all forms of religious belief. [18]How about Spiritual but non-Religious beliefs Sir?) The Holy Roman Ctholic Church (Official name of Corporation) distances itself from its Priesthood by making clergy Contractors, not paying Social Security for them, making them pay income taxes and including as Income living in the Rectory where they are forced to reside.

VWow.. there are soo many uneducated comments.. Our country  was not founded on religion, it was founded on the beliefs of Europe and such. The under god stuff in our pledges and on our money does not mean anything it is just there; and for those who are against religion or the views of them there is no reason you should be feeling  offended  or thinking that this under god stuff has anything to impose on you.  A lot of people are led to believe things and not think for oneself for they fear the unknown.What i don't understand is how people accept crap like sex before marriage, same sex couples, obesity in children, i'll even toss in the little bigotry people who label others ( like myself) as bigots for not accepting others views and disregarding my own( which I do accept others opinions and such just I do not toss out my won). Yet when you hear someone say  Amen, Thank God They get a disgusting look upon their face. Like why do people feel it is okay to hate god or a person who has strong religious values just because you do not agree with them? And for all those saying state and church are separate :) foolishness! It may say so in the Constitution and such but it is not fully true. Many churches support governments.

If you take that out we might as well change all the laws our country has seeing how they are based the many 10 commandments (i.e. lying (fraud), murder, stealing, adultery). If you take God out of this then you are begging for even more corruption in our government.

As evidenced by the number of comments on this question, compared to the number of comments on the question of, Should marijuana be a medical option?  There is a school of thought or ideology that says, White European Men are superior in that they know more, they know the answer, and thats the way it is.  Those people may call the United States a Christian nation, but the truth is that the era of white male dominance, exemplified in the system of corporations that has grown to encompass the world, is on the descent.  Look to the current politics of the Latin Americas for an indigenous perspective, and you will see that the historical White Male Superiority perspective is not the only way.

As evidenced by the number of comments on this question, compared to the number of comments on the question of, Should marijuana be a medical option?  There is a school of thought or ideology that says, White European Men are superior in that they know more, they know the answer, and thats the way it is.  Those people may call the United States a Christian nation, but the truth is that the era of white male dominance, exemplified in the system of corporations that has grown to encompass the world, is on the descent.

I am trying to be tolerant of my Christian, Jewish, Muslim, and other friends just as they have been tolerant of me and my ideals. I personal don't feel insulted by the inclusion of those words. I also don't think they are meant to combine the words believer and patriot. I say the pledge just like any other God fearing American would even though I don't  have the faith in a higher being that my friends have. I think that for atheists God can be translated into, possibly, a higher purpose or a set of ideals that better us without the need for a particular religion.

VThe pledge was written by a Baptist minister, who was also a socialist, in 1892. It was intended as a pledge of loyalty to the symbol of the United States and, therefore, the nation it represents. It included the notion that those who pledge are united in their respect for and support of the country. Adding under God indicates the person is also expressing loyalty to God as well, thus seriously diminishing the intent and impact of the original document. It certainly undermines the indivisible part. What's most important, is to do everything possible to ensure our government is secular. The Bush years have given us a glimpse of just how damaging a faith-based government can be.

VSince the majority of the people in America believe in either the Jewish, Christian, or Muslim faith, and it is the majority who get to have a say, with respect to the rights of the minority, of course, the answer is a simple Yes, because first of all, this nation was founded by people who believed in the God of the Christian religion, which happens also to be the same God of the Jews, and of the Muslims.  A simple lesson in history confirms that the Jews believed in the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; the Christian religion came out of the Jewish faith and added the teachings, life, and purpose of Jesus Christ but also held to the God of Abraham, and the Muslim, who calls him Allah, also believes in the God of Abraham.  So, since the majority believe and hope that this nation, under God, is indivisible and provides liberty and justice for all, notable tenets of all three major faiths, the phrase should stand.

VIf you go up to an al-queda member and say Hey you, God doesn't exist. Your bombing buddies died for nothing and you stand for nothing, you'll get killed. Since the Holocausts, no one really wants to try to make fun of Jewish people or do anything to offend them in general. Not that they don't have a good reason, as it was a terrible thing. So we link this statement with the Christian God. However, when you say this, you are mocking Jews and Muslims as if their belief of God is inferior and not a threat to be dealt with. Seperation of church and state. Hey buddy, WHICH ONE! Why do we not act like the God said isn't one respected by all other religions. Athesism is not a religion, it is the absence of religion. Therefore, in no way is this a violation of the first Amendment as it includes all religions. Even polytheistic religions believe that their gods come together to form God.

Though I have grown up in a Christian household, the pledge has never been more to me about God than it is about my allegiance to the State. The phrase 'under God' should not be taken as more than a simple 'common good.' Despite what is heard from radicals and extremists about God's wrath, the majority of world consensus that has any understanding of the word 'God' from the Christian sense is that God is commonly good and supports that which is for the common good of society.

VA pledge is something you should say only if you mean it. That is the whole purpose of a pledge or an oath. So the words Under God immediately undermine the promise someone has made if they worship multiple gods, Goddess, no god, a whole pantheon, or any deity that does not go by the name of God.  If I'm going to pledge to my country, I want to mean every word I say, and I can't if I do not believe in/worship God

VThe Pledge of Allegiance, in its current form, is a throwback to the days of the Cold War and the ideological fight against the godless Soviet Union.  Even though I wasn't around for the Cold War, I understand why under God was added, mostly to say This is America, not the Soviet Union!  We're better because we believe in God!  Similar reasoning applies for making the national motto In God We Trust.  What, exactly, does people trusting in God say about the US as a country?  Looking at it from a secular point of view, I think that's an inferior motto to E Pluribus Unum, which sums up this country perfectly.  Lots of people don't believe in the Judeo-Christian deity, and not just the nonreligious.  Is the government calling all of those people unpatriotic?  The answer is definitely yes.  Here's a simple test:  Try replacing it with under Allah or under Vishnu.  Think that's any different?  It's not.  Same message, just aimed at different groups.  From the Bible Belt, here's a vote to get under God out of the Pledge, and for E Pluribus Unum as the motto.

VThe phrase 'under God' acts as a limit on what is otherwise an unlimited promise of allegiance to a state. Without 'under God' the pledge becomes a promise to support whatever the current policies of the government are. With 'under God' included, I can comfortably recite the pledge knowing that when the government adopts some policy that is contrary to the 'Laws of Nature and of Nature's God' I can reject the policy without breaking my promise. Unlimited allegiance to a state is not a good thing, as the historic examples of World War II show us. The United States is not guiltless on this score either. In my own life the government has carried laws on the books that were unfair to blacks, to women, to the native inhabitants of this continent. Our current policy on interrogation by torture of supposed enemy combatants seems to be another example. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The greatest danger to the exercise of any freedom, religious or otherwise, is the unchecked power of the organized state. The phrase 'under God' acts as a check on that authority. It is a little reminder to those who might tend to abuse their position that I will not blindly act based on state dictates but will apply other standards when deciding my own actions.

VI grew up with a Pledge that did not include under God in it. I was always happy to say that Pledge, which had great meaning for me.  However, somewhere along the way, under God was added and I then became embarrassed to say the Pledge because I thought that under God did not belong there. We are a country with the separation of church and state (thank God, because I believe in God) and for me, having under God in the Pledge belies that fact. If I am now ever in a situation that includes reciting the Pledge, I will of course do so but without saying those two words. The Pledge should belong to all of us and with the words under God in it, I do not think it does. Respectfully submitted.

Vour nation is not a Christian nation as many of the pros have stated we are a diverse nation with multiple religions who practice Judaism Islamic buddism and Hinduism.we even have people here who believe there is no god at all.if the us declared itself a Christian nation we would alienate multiple different cultures existing in the us. we would imply that every in the Christian bible represents the beliefs of our entire nation.the problem that people are having with the under god part of the pledge isn't really the words in it but the potiental future those words could lead us to.it never even specifies in the pledge which god they are talking about the pros are just implying its the Christian god.I could name a million different gods if you asked me.the words really should be removed.it just allows religion to weed its way around the legal issue of church and state further.any implication of religion including in the pledge should be removed. it just creates to many assumptions and prevents us from not imposing our beliefs on others.we need to accept that not everyone is Christian and not everyone believes in god.im an atheist but im not any less moral.i think as a society we can move away from religion in legal issues.

Separation of church and state just means that the government will not restrict us on our religious beliefs.  I do see the point of view that requiring God to be used in such a way takes away meaning and glory to his name, but it does recognize that he is in charge.

VWell, i think that no religious statement should be included in the Pledge of Allegiance. When people refer to any religion, they should be in the situation in which they respect and follow that specific God or Goddess (whichever, one or more) and remain in the boundaries of supporting the land in which they created. If, for example, the U.S is considered a religious country, then if they speak about God, they should consider thinking about what God does for his people, not only what he chooses for being wishy-washy. He can't prohibit something the U.S for being different or because something looks bad or inappropriate as some might say. You can't talk about a specific religion unless you truly understand it, it's not logic for anyone to think like that.

I am trying to be tolerant of my Christian, Jewish, Muslim, and other friends just as they have been tolerant of me and my ideals. I personal don't feel insulted by the inclusion of those words. I also don't think they are meant to combine the words believer and patriot. I say the pledge just like any other God fearing American would even though I don't  have the faith in a higher being that my friends have.

It would be different if our Four Father's knew about the way American turned out to be.  Since we took God out of school, our school is over run with children who doesn't listen or mind.  And people wonder why there is so many children shooting other children and adults.  This does include at school, in the street, in our neighborhoods.  Kids are not afraid of consequence for there actions.  Now we have adults who don't care what their children do to others.  People wonder why American is the way that it is.  Think about it.

And people wonder why there is so many children shooting other children and adults.  This does include at school, in the street, in our neighborhoods.  Kids are not afraid of consequence for there actions.  Now we have adults who don't care what their children do to others.  People wonder why American is the way that it is.  Think about it.

Congress shall make no law holding one religion over another, this clearly favors the christian god over a atheists idea or a muslim deity.Even though the pledge doesn't specify which God America is under, it still discriminates against Atheists. We have a separation of Church and State. The words Under God were not even part of the original pledge and were added in the 50's due an unfounded fear of Communism.

VI was in elementary school when under god was added to the pledge. I never added to my recitation of the pledge. This nation was founded on the basis of secularism. That was the intention of the Founding Fathers. Ever since, some zealous religious folks have tried to impose their agenda on others.  The insertion of under god into the US Pledge of Allegiance is such an example of their success in damaging this nation's moral integrity.  The US Pledge of Allegiance should not require citizens to accept Bronze-age mythology. The pledge should be, I pledge allegiance to the republic of the United States of America, one nation indivisible with liberty and justice for all. The pledge is not to a flag; it is to the republic. -- Howard Schulsinger (aka, Austin)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;...I contemplate with sovereign reverence that act of the whole American people which declared that their legislature should make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof,  thus building a wall of separation between Church &amp; State. -- Thomas Jefferson &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Build up that wall. -- Christopher Hitchens

VI understand why people want that phrase in there, I do. At the same time however, how in our day and age, with such a diverse group of subcultures within our great country, can we allow something that blatantly disregards all other deities believed in by other Americans? Yes, the majority of Americans may believe in Catholicism and thus not have a problem with the phrase, but being selfless for a second, instead of self-centered, taking those two words out makes a bit of a difference to those who do not believe in that specific deity or any at all. And if we're being honest, why does it matter so much to keep it in?      Some might think, I want it in because I am a devout Christian (or whatever) and I want to represent that in my daily life. But, you know what, that's what churches and other places of worship are for.      Last time I checked, being proud to be an American meant being proud to embrace everything America is built on, namely diversity. We are supposed to be a melting pot of cultures, but with such a phrase, how can we call ourselves truly diverse? I do not think it is bad, just with all of the different religions (and lack there of) it is out of date.

VThe original anthem did not have the phrase Under God within it. That was something that was added during the Cold War as a way for us to attempt to differentiate us from 'Godless heathens'. As well, the US Constitution states that our Country and Government are to be separate from any and all religions. Therefor, the current existence of the phrase Under God is something that is closer being against our nation's ideals than keeping it, it's just never been changed because a lot of people don't understand why some people want it removed. Also, it's not 'Our' flag, it's the flag of any and all American citizens, not just the ones who happen to believe in the existence of your God or any God for that matter. I believe it should be removed because it was added erroneously in the first place and furthers the misnomer other progressive countries have that we're a backwards and ignorant gathering of bigots and idiots

VNo, the words under God should not be included in the US Pledge of Allegiance because they are completely unnecessary and cause far too much contreversy for what they are worth. The pledge went without conflict until the 1950's, when a Catholic interest group convinced the President to add the words. It was only once the words were added that it became a problem. Then, the recitation of the pledge became wrong for many citizens as it was now more of a prayer, both to a monotheistic God and another idol which is banned in Judaism. Thus, more and more kids are being pressured into saying things that conflict with their religion in school because by not doing so, they are thought to be unpatriotic. This may seem like a pretty stupid analogy, but personally I think it explains the concept very well. This whole debate is like sandwiches and mayonaise. Some people may be allergic to Mayo. Some people may really enjoy aMayo on their sandwich. But the people who like the Mayo are able to eat the sandwitch without, while people who are allergic CAN'T eat the Mayo. This is like the under god debate because religious people can say the pledge without, but atheists or other conflictiong interests can't say the phrase. It should be removed

There is no proof of gods existence and religion and state MUST be separate in order for all US citizens to be included. Taking the phrase out would do absolutely no harm to any religion or practicing religious people in this country, but it would include every citizen without anyone or any belief system being disregarded, disrespected or left out.

VThe pledge was written by a Baptist minister, who was also a socialist, in 1892. It was intended as a pledge of loyalty to the symbol of the United States and, therefore, the nation it represents. It included the notion that those who pledge are united in their respect for and support of the country. Adding under God indicates the person is also expressing loyalty to God as well, thus seriously diminishing the intent and impact of the original document. It certainly undermines the indivisible part. What's most important, is to do everything possible to ensure our government is secular. The Bush years have given us a glimpse of just how damaging a faith-based government can be.

I read all these statements about how it isn't a religious statement, blah blah blah.  So really God is not a religious statement?  I wonder who they think they are kidding with that!  The simple fact is the religious Christian majority got their way against everything this nation stands for and is founded on and no one in government or in the courts has the guts to stand up for what's right and fix it.  Why? Because they are scared for their positions in government.  So here we sit a nation with an awesome document set in place to provide protections for all American citizens with a law that discriminates against non Christian citizens.  How is that right?  It makes our stand as a nation of freedoms a worldwide giggling session,  oh, you mean America, the land of religious freedom where you have to, by law swear an oath to the Christian god? someone has to explain to me how that is religious freedom.

VThe phrase 'under God' acts as a limit on what is otherwise an unlimited promise of allegiance to a state. Without 'under God' the pledge becomes a promise to support whatever the current policies of the government are. With 'under God' included, I can comfortably recite the pledge knowing that when the government adopts some policy that is contrary to the 'Laws of Nature and of Nature's God' I can reject the policy without breaking my promise. Unlimited allegiance to a state is not a good thing, as the historic examples of World War II show us. The United States is not guiltless on this score either. In my own life the government has carried laws on the books that were unfair to blacks, to women, to the native inhabitants of this continent. Our current policy on interrogation by torture of supposed enemy combatants seems to be another example. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The greatest danger to the exercise of any freedom, religious or otherwise, is the unchecked power of the organized state. The phrase 'under God' acts as a check on that authority. It is a little reminder to those who might tend to abuse their position that I will not blindly act based on state dictates but will apply other standards when deciding my own actions.

VThe so-called Under God part wasn't in the constitution until 1954 or so, when the fear of communism was around. Nothing more, and it is absurd that they put it in there to begin with, especially since there are people who don't believe, and don't care about that. Why Eisenhower did that, no idea, but I bet he didn't believe it either, it was more for purposes of propaganda, when in reality, it was a sham. As far as the constitution goes, it was put in, but people are too afraid to revert to the original. And for those who don't believe, why force it into their vocabulary, right? It would be best to let the PERSON decide if they want to say that part. It doesn't matter if you are a believer or not, since this is the land of the free, we have the right to say under god, or not to. The people should make the choice to say under god, or under the nation, or the USA. After all, our founding fathers left their country, because they wanted freedom. Shouldn't freedom be on ALL levels? If so, then we shouldn't worry about something as trivial as putting under god in the pledge. It is a choice to say under god or not.

As well, the US Constitution states that our Country and Government are to be separate from any and all religions. Therefor, the current existence of the phrase Under God is something that is closer being against our nation's ideals than keeping it, it's just never been changed because a lot of people don't understand why some people want it removed. Also, it's not 'Our' flag, it's the flag of any and all American citizens, not just the ones who happen to believe in the existence of your God or any God for that matter.

The insertion of under god into the US Pledge of Allegiance is such an example of their success in damaging this nation's moral integrity.  The US Pledge of Allegiance should not require citizens to accept Bronze-age mythology. The pledge should be, I pledge allegiance to the republic of the United States of America, one nation indivisible with liberty and justice for all.

The founding fathers specifically made a godless constitution and keeping god out of government it essential. Religion has a habit of incorporating cult activities and hatred for others outside their click. I also believe it was in 1948 that Louis bowman inserted, under God And then Eisenhower made it official in 1954. If I am not mistaken it was in response to the perceived threat of communism. The Christian Reich is constantly trying to state that the us was founded on their principles when it was not. In fact, the Christian clergy was dead set against Thomas Jefferson because of his views and statements on Christians. I think it was Thomas Paine who people called the father of the American revolution? Until he wrote a book on his beliefs of deism criticizing Christians. I believe it was called age of reason. Anyway after that Christians in their usual clickish way ostracized him and he died as an outcast. He was an extremely brilliant man.

VFreedom of religion also includes those who do not believe in anything, including a god. God has no place in any government funded organization.  I do not care where we came from, or where I go when I die. I am only good for the sake of being good. By leaving under god in the pledge our children are hearing a phrase which is not true in any form. No one is under god since there is no proof one exist. It is a pointless addition to the pledge, which is otherwise a statement our children are taught at a very early age. I refused to say the pledge completely because of the under god phrase, and I was left alone because no one wanted to battle with my Atheist father.

This means two things, the first being that the government shall not interfere with the church. But how can we do that if one religious interpretation is in the government? If we have a Christian based government, as the pledge implies, how can we be sure that the government will be fair to all beliefs? The best way is to keep church out of state.

VGod belongs in church and not in our government, courts or schools. We need to stop using the bible to swear in govenment officials, we need to remove god from our currency and from the pledge. Why, because God has no place in any of them. People claim that yes, children have the right to refrain from saying the pledge in school or ommit the words under god, but children are not capable of makin a decision on what to them seems like an obligation, which is to stand and recite the pledge. I am an adult and I still feel strange to stand there and not recite when the rest of them do. It feels like you are being forced to do something you don't want to do.

VI myself being Catholic believe that the words 'under God' should not be included in a pledge of allegiance to the flag of the United States. As is evident, the nation was based on ideals of religious freedom, and if somebody wishes to remain a patriot, pledging allegiance to their country, they should not be coerced to state something they don't believe to be true. Although a democratic government is based on majorities in the long run, in this case we very well may be violating the rights guaranteed to citizens via the Bill of Rights. The founding fathers, when constructing the constitution may have included references to their own religion, in this case Catholicism, but as we see a certain diversity being created in this past century, it is important to note that we as a nation should be more open to accept these different ideas to better suit all citizens. nnThat said, maybe it would have been easier to go along with the pledge that was first introduced which would have allowed for every citizen to feel their place in the country.

VThis is controversial when it shouldn't be. Under God simply refers to the founding fathers principles for which the nation was founded. You can remove it, but that doesn't change the fact that it was founded with that in mind.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If I recite the pledge, the Under God part is not reflectant on my own personal religious beliefs. Its a pledge to my country with an acknowledgement that it was founded Under God..... not by me, but our founding fathers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Isn't God an all encompassing term anyway? Don't all religions worship to some form of God? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Most importantly, aren't the ones who recite the POA typically children?

I don't think so. I recited it as a child but that did not stop me from choosing what I chose to believe today.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My point is, out of respect for those who it did matter to when the country was founded, and out of respect and love for the history of my country, I see no reason why it should be removed.

VI am 15. I'm in high school. I am not religious. I respect everyone's beliefs even if I disagree, however I do not force my beliefs on others, and I lose respect for someone else's opinion when they shove it in my face. I do not believe that God should be used in anything children are forced to memorize and blindly repeat. We are brainwashing our children. We need to teach them to think for themselves, not through the government. Also, children shouldn't be forced to pledge to a country. Teach the children to analyze their country when they are old enough then let THEM decide if they wish to pledge to their country. I for one am glad I live in America, but I am not proud of my country and don't want to pledge to it, let alone a god that I don't believe in. God may be real to some, but he is not real to me. I respect those that believe in God and they need to respect those that are different than them.

I read all these statements about how it isn't a religious statement, blah blah blah.  So really God is not a religious statement?  I wonder who they think they are kidding with that!  The simple fact is the religious Christian majority got their way against everything this nation stands for and is founded on and no one in government or in the courts has the guts to stand up for what's right and fix it.  Why? Because they are scared for their positions in government.  So here we sit a nation with an awesome document set in place to provide protections for all American citizens with a law that discriminates against non Christian citizens.  How is that right?  It makes our stand as a nation of freedoms a worldwide giggling session,  oh, you mean America, the land of religious freedom where you have to, by law swear an oath to the Christian god? someone has to explain to me how that is religious freedom.

VNo, the words under God should not be included in the US Pledge of Allegiance because they are completely unnecessary and cause far too much contreversy for what they are worth. The pledge went without conflict until the 1950's, when a Catholic interest group convinced the President to add the words. It was only once the words were added that it became a problem. Then, the recitation of the pledge became wrong for many citizens as it was now more of a prayer, both to a monotheistic God and another idol which is banned in Judaism. Thus, more and more kids are being pressured into saying things that conflict with their religion in school because by not doing so, they are thought to be unpatriotic. This may seem like a pretty stupid analogy, but personally I think it explains the concept very well. This whole debate is like sandwiches and mayonaise. Some people may be allergic to Mayo. Some people may really enjoy aMayo on their sandwich. But the people who like the Mayo are able to eat the sandwitch without, while people who are allergic CAN'T eat the Mayo. This is like the under god debate because religious people can say the pledge without, but atheists or other conflictiong interests can't say the phrase. It should be removed

While I don't have a problem saying it, I think it is more a matter of principle, as it is a glaring violation of the !st ammendment in one of the most common practices in the United States today.

Religion has a habit of incorporating cult activities and hatred for others outside their click.

The Christian Reich is constantly trying to state that the us was founded on their principles when it was not.

VWell, i think that no religious statement should be included in the Pledge of Allegiance. When people refer to any religion, they should be in the situation in which they respect and follow that specific God or Goddess (whichever, one or more) and remain in the boundaries of supporting the land in which they created. If, for example, the U.S is considered a religious country, then if they speak about God, they should consider thinking about what God does for his people, not only what he chooses for being wishy-washy. He can't prohibit something the U.S for being different or because something looks bad or inappropriate as some might say. You can't talk about a specific religion unless you truly understand it, it's not logic for anyone to think like that.

If, for example, the U.S is considered a religious country, then if they speak about God, they should consider thinking about what God does for his people, not only what he chooses for being wishy-washy. He can't prohibit something the U.S for being different or because something looks bad or inappropriate as some might say. You can't talk about a specific religion unless you truly understand it, it's not logic for anyone to think like that.

Why, because God has no place in any of them. People claim that yes, children have the right to refrain from saying the pledge in school or ommit the words under god, but children are not capable of makin a decision on what to them seems like an obligation, which is to stand and recite the pledge.

This is a slap in the face to all the atheists, agnostics and other unbelievers who proudly served this country in law enforcement, fire departments and military.

VCan an unbeliever be patriotic? Not according to religious conservatives, it seems. They wish, no, they demand that we retain 'under God' in the pledge of allegiance. They want patriotism and faith in God to be a package deal without the option of separation. Thus, unbelievers are deemed unpatriotic. This is a slap in the face to all the atheists, agnostics and other unbelievers who proudly served this country in law enforcement, fire departments and military. Let's make the pledge for all Americans, believers and unbelievers alike. The pledge should not be the exclusive property of the religious.

Baptist Association was concerned the power of government would be used to enforce religious rule. The I Amendment exists just as much to protect religion from the depredations of government as the other way around.nnOne can use as a simple rule of thumb the following: if one believes his position is not religious privilege then it should be acceptable to substitute any other religious view. For example, in the case of the pledge, how many Christians would object to One Nation, Under Krishna?nnThe Bill of Rights do not exist to protect majority privilege, the majority do not need protection. They exist to protect the minority from the tyranny of democracy. Rights are not something one votes on, they are either rights, shared by all, or they are privileges, which those in power confer on others.nnAs a (now-disabled) vet, I swore to uphold the Constitution. Not any religious faith. By upholding the Constitution, all of faith may hold the faith they choose, even though I personally feel faith (belief without good evidence) is -not- a virtue.

VJust for whom does the flag wave anyway? The official pledge to it marginalizes many if not most with the 1954 addition of, One nation under God. When taking the enlistment oath, upon entry to the U.S. military we vets swore to defend the Constitution of the United States, not it's banner.

VWhether or not under God was initially meant to mean the Christian God or not, it should not be considered offensive. Though I have grown up in a Christian household, the pledge has never been more to me about God than it is about my allegiance to the State. The phrase 'under God' should not be taken as more than a simple 'common good.' Despite what is heard from radicals and extremists about God's wrath, the majority of world consensus that has any understanding of the word 'God' from the Christian sense is that God is commonly good and supports that which is for the common good of society.

VAbsolutely not, faith in a God should be completely personal. There should never be anything, i.e. money, constitution, pledge etc that has God anywhere on it. Faith is a choice, atheisim or being agnostic is a choice. I shouldn't have to believe in god, just as you shouldn't have to not believe in god. And I shouldn't be forced to say it in a pledge or see it in the constitution or see it on every dollar bill. To me the idea of God is ridiculous, but to the faithful he is real. Either way, this is completely personal and a personal choice. It's called freedom.

VAbsolutely not, faith in a God should be completely personal. There should never be anything, i.e. money, constitution, pledge etc that has God anywhere on it. Faith is a choice, atheisim or being agnostic is a choice. I shouldn't have to believe in god, just as you shouldn't have to not believe in god. And I shouldn't be forced to say it in a pledge or see it in the constitution or see it on every dollar bill. To me the idea of God is ridiculous, but to the faithful he is real. Either way, this is completely personal and a personal choice. It's called freedom.

VWow.. there are soo many uneducated comments.. Our country  was not founded on religion, it was founded on the beliefs of Europe and such. The under god stuff in our pledges and on our money does not mean anything it is just there; and for those who are against religion or the views of them there is no reason you should be feeling  offended  or thinking that this under god stuff has anything to impose on you.  A lot of people are led to believe things and not think for oneself for they fear the unknown.What i don't understand is how people accept crap like sex before marriage, same sex couples, obesity in children, i'll even toss in the little bigotry people who label others ( like myself) as bigots for not accepting others views and disregarding my own( which I do accept others opinions and such just I do not toss out my won). Yet when you hear someone say  Amen, Thank God They get a disgusting look upon their face. Like why do people feel it is okay to hate god or a person who has strong religious values just because you do not agree with them? And for all those saying state and church are separate :) foolishness! It may say so in the Constitution and such but it is not fully true. Many churches support governments.

VThe Pledge of Allegiance, in its current form, is a throwback to the days of the Cold War and the ideological fight against the godless Soviet Union.  Even though I wasn't around for the Cold War, I understand why under God was added, mostly to say This is America, not the Soviet Union!  We're better because we believe in God!  Similar reasoning applies for making the national motto In God We Trust.  What, exactly, does people trusting in God say about the US as a country?  Looking at it from a secular point of view, I think that's an inferior motto to E Pluribus Unum, which sums up this country perfectly.  Lots of people don't believe in the Judeo-Christian deity, and not just the nonreligious.  Is the government calling all of those people unpatriotic?  The answer is definitely yes.  Here's a simple test:  Try replacing it with under Allah or under Vishnu.  Think that's any different?  It's not.  Same message, just aimed at different groups.  From the Bible Belt, here's a vote to get under God out of the Pledge, and for E Pluribus Unum as the motto.

It was a Christian country, even though the 1st amendment states freedom of religion. And it still does. The country can be religious without persecuting those who do not believe the same, and that's exactly how it is. No one is punished for believing whatever they want, they are free to worship when, how, where, and who they want. but they should NOT have the freedom to change our country's background. Our currency has 'in God we trust' on it, our forefathers were christian men who feared God. That is how our country rose to be the greatest, most powerful country in the world. Now that our country is starting to turn its back on God, look what has happened. Crime, divorce, drug, and suicide rates have all risen. Not to mention the country has been surpassed by many countries, is in trillions of dollars of debt, and is pretty much owned by China.

VI am 15. I'm in high school. I am not religious. I respect everyone's beliefs even if I disagree, however I do not force my beliefs on others, and I lose respect for someone else's opinion when they shove it in my face. I do not believe that God should be used in anything children are forced to memorize and blindly repeat. We are brainwashing our children. We need to teach them to think for themselves, not through the government. Also, children shouldn't be forced to pledge to a country. Teach the children to analyze their country when they are old enough then let THEM decide if they wish to pledge to their country. I for one am glad I live in America, but I am not proud of my country and don't want to pledge to it, let alone a god that I don't believe in. God may be real to some, but he is not real to me. I respect those that believe in God and they need to respect those that are different than them.

VAtheism doesn't mean the absence of religion - it means the absence of a god in one's belief system.  Certain forms of Buddhism, for example are atheistic.  Therefore, requiring a statement of belief in a god is unconstitutionally preferring a majority religious belief over a minority one.  The point of the Pledge is to state allegiance to the flag and country.  If one believes in a god, there are many, many other forums in which to express that belief without imposing it on others.

Indeed, most of our founding fathers claimed membership in one sect of Christianity or another. But how does that help your argument?  If they wanted to establish a theocracy, they would have done so.  Instead, they insisted upon a wall of separation between church and state.   In every country and every age, the priest has been hostile to liberty. He is always in alliance with the despot...they have perverted the purest religion ever preached to man into mystery and jargon, unintelligible to all mankind, and therefore the safer for their purposes. -Jefferson  Note the purest religion, yet still insisted against its influence in gov.

VI believe the words 'under God' should remain in our pledge. This country was founded on solid Christian principals. We have been blessed and became a great nation because we believed and lived up to these principals. The farther we get from our source of greatness which is God, the more morally corrupt we become. Our nation is being destroyed from within as we continue to take God out of our lives.

Now, being an athiest, I guess I have a more bias opinion, but this line is basically stating only the people calling this higher power 'God' are included as patriots, and this line violates our first amendment rights. why is this line still here? or better yet, why was it added in the first place?

There is no possible way that a few rebels could beat a world power and become their own country. Our forefathers knew God. Our forefathers knew that God had helped them and would continue to bless this country so they decided to put God into several things including the Constitution and our Pledge of Allegiance.

VReligion has nothing in common with the basis the United States was founded on: separation of church and state. Because of events like the Salem witch trials, the Founding Fathers deemed that religion should not interfere with government, and stated so in the establishment clause of the First Amendment.  The reason the words under God were added after World War II is because of something very similar to the Salem witch trials: McCarthyism. Except then, people with any relation communism were the ones hunted and blacklisted by a corrupt government. The Cold War has ended, as has the religious intolerance and paranoia, so these words have no place in the Pledge, if they ever did at all.

VNo, the counrty was founded on the very Idea of religious freedom and NOT on Christianity like most believe. The founding fathers were secular, and created a secular country. The words under god weren't added until the 1950's as anti-soviet propaganda, as the USSR endorsed non-religion. While I don't have a problem saying it, I think it is more a matter of principle, as it is a glaring violation of the !st ammendment in one of the most common practices in the United States today.
